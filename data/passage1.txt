One day the old emperor Shahjahan became ill. His son Aurangzeb, who always wanted to be the emperor, put his father in a jail. Jahanara Begum, the eldest child of Shahjahan, did not leave her father and went to jail along with him. She said, “ I shall share the suffering of my father. He needs me in his old age, and I shall never leave him.” Shahjahan lived in the jail for seven years and then he died. During that period, Princess Jahanara stayed with him and took care of him. After the death of her father, she returned to her own palace. She continued to live there and spent the rest of her life serving the needy and the poor. Before her death, she gave away all her money to the poor and the needy. She was highly educated and well-versed in Persian and Arabic, as well as a writer, painter and poet. Jahanara was Shahjahan’s preferred child. Legend says that once when Aurangzeb was severely sick, Jahanara took care of him. Jahanara died on September 5, 1681, at the age of 67. Upon her death, Aurangzeb gave her the posthumous title: Sahibat-uz-Zamani (mistress of age).
