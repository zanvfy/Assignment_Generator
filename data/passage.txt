Lakshadweep is an archipelago located 200 – 400 km west of the coast of Kerala in the Arabian Sea. The archipelago consists of 36 main islands and many smaller islands, coral atolls and coral reefs. It is the smallest union territory in India. Lakshadweep means a hundred thousand islands in the local language, Malayalam. Earlier the name Lakshadweep referred to the three archipelagos in the Indian Ocean, the present Lakshadweep, Maldives and Suvadives. Only — ten of the Lakshadweep islands are inhabited and more than 90 percent of the indigenous population is Muslims. The main economic activities are fishing, coconut cultivation and coir twisting. Tourism is an emerging industry. Tourists require an entry permit to visit Lakshadweep; the permit is issued in Kochi (in Kerala). Foreign nationals are allowed only in kadmat, Bangaram and Agatti islands. Coconut is the main crop cultivated on the island. Lakshadweep is India’s largest producer of coconuts. About 2,598 hectares are under coconut cultivation and the productivity per hectare is 22,310. Coconuts cultivated in the Lakshadweep are also rich in coconut oil.
